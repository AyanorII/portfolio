        Hello, my name is Ayanori Toyoda, I was born and raised in Brazil and

        I started to learn web development in May 2021 and went to one of most
        famous bootcamps in Japan and in the world. I love and focus more on
        front end development but also have experience with back end
        technologies.

      <Typography variant="body1">
        Since I started my journey to become a developer, Iâ€™ve been building
        real-life like, fully responsive side projects to help me learn new
        technologies and apply all of my knowledge while always keep learning
        new things.
